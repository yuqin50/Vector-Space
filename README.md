## The Goal:
The course is designed to introduce graduate students to key concepts from advanced linear algebra that are used regularly in ECE/CS 
journal papers on **```signal processing, communications, circuit design, and machine learning```**.    
For each topic, the course will present the key mathematical ideas (and their proof) and then demonstrate how these ideas are applied 
in practice.    
The goal is to use application topics such as **```Markov chains, alternating projections, and pattern classification```** to illustrate important
mathematical topics.    
The mathematical topics will include:    
```
Logic/set theory; metric spaces; continuity, convergence, and separability in metric spaces; 
inner-product spaces and Hilbert spaces; operators in finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces; 
representation, best approximation,and optimal filtering; 
eigensystems, spectral theorems, and singular value decomposition.
```
